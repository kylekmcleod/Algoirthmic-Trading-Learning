# Algorithmic Trading Project

This repository documents my learning journey in machine learning and algorithmic trading. The goal of this project is to learn how to gather data and apply it to a machine learning model to predict which stocks will be the most profitable in the coming month. The data is extracted from the S&P 500 using Yahoo Finance. The features included in the model are: atr, bb_high, bb_low, bb_med, garman_klass_vol, macd, rsi, return_1m, return_2m, return_3m, return_6m, return_9m, return_12m, Mkt-RF, SMB, HML, RMW, and CMA.
